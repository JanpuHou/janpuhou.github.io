Small and midsize enterprises increasingly utilize public cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud for deploying IT applications to run their business. Hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) is underpinned by many of the same distributed systems technologies as public clouds, enabling IT organizations to build private clouds that bring benefits of cloud computing into organizationsâ€™ datacenters. The reasons organizations make the switch by moving from complex legacy infrastructure to the simplicity of hyperconvergence are lower costs, improved, consistent performance, a smaller datacenter footprint, greater efficiency and productivity in IT teams, and maximized infrastructure ROI.

Take advantage of software-defined compute, storage, and networking on a broad range of form factors and brands. HCI software help enterprise to modernize infrastructure, consolidate virtualized workloads, and increase efficiency. Azure Stack HCI is a hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) operating system to deploy and run Windows and Linux virtual machines (VMs) in your datacenter or at the edge using your existing tools, processes, and skill sets. Extend your datacenter to the cloud with Azure Backup, Azure Monitor, and Azure Security Center.
